    "# Where to open another chain of your restaurant in Toronto\n",
    "## Introduction/Business Problem\n",
    "When you are a successful entrepreneur in a city, say in this case Toronto, owning a well running restaurant, you could naturally think about opening another chain store. Through clustering, the entrepreneur can find similar spots that might replicate the success of the existing business.\n",
    "## Data Section\n",
    "I will continue working on the data presented in previous weeks:  \n",
    "1. Borough and neighborhood data scraping from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M. This gives a basic idea of different neighborhood\n",
    "2. Latitude and longitude provided in the file “Geospatial_Coordinates.csv”. This tells us the latitude and longitude information of the neighborhood\n",
    "3. Using Foursquare to acquire business information, so that neighborhood with similar business type could be clustered together. "
